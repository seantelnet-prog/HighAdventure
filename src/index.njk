  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>The Made With Claw workflow is designed to minimize friction and maximize output. Here's what a typical development session looks like:</p>
  
  <div class="stack-overview">
    <h3>The Development Loop</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Describe Your Change</strong> Tell your OpenClaw assistant what you want in plain English: "Add a new services page for web development with pricing info."</li>
      <li><strong>2. Review the Preview</strong> Your assistant creates the page, pushes to a feature branch, and Amplify generates a preview URL within 60 seconds.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Iterate Quickly</strong> Request tweaks via chat: "Make the headline more compelling" or "Add a testimonial section." Each change gets its own preview.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Merge When Ready</strong> Once you're satisfied, approve the PR. Changes go live on your production site automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>5. Repeat</strong> The entire cycle takes minutes, not hours. Build an entire website in an afternoon.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <p>Common questions about building websites with OpenClaw and this stack.</p>
  
  <div class="faq">
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What technical knowledge do I need?</h3>
      <p>This guide assumes basic technical literacy. You should be comfortable with (or willing to learn) concepts like AWS account setup, SSH keys, API keys, Git basics, and HTML/JavaScript fundamentals. OpenClaw handles the heavy lifting, but you'll need foundational knowledge to understand what's happening and troubleshoot when things don't go as expected. If terms like "environment variables" or "DNS records" are completely foreign, spend some time with the basics first.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How much does it cost to run a site on this stack?</h3>
      <p>For most small to medium websites, hosting costs are minimal. AWS Amplify's free tier includes 1,000 build minutes per month and 15 GB of bandwidth. Beyond that, you're looking at roughly $0.01 per build minute and $0.15 per GB of bandwidth. A typical small business site costs $1-5 per month to host. Compare that to $20-50/month for traditional managed hosting.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I use my existing domain name?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. You can either transfer your domain to Route 53 (recommended for full integration) or keep it with your current registrar and just point the DNS records to Amplify. The domain setup guide walks you through both options step by step.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How fast are the websites built with this template?</h3>
      <p>Extremely fast. Static sites generated by 11ty typically achieve perfect or near-perfect scores on <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>. Pages load in under 1 second on most connections because there's no server-side processing — just pre-built HTML served from edge locations near your visitors.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What if I need features like contact forms or e-commerce?</h3>
      <p>Static sites can absolutely handle dynamic features. For contact forms, you can use services like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or AWS Lambda functions. For e-commerce, Snipcart or Stripe Checkout integrate seamlessly. Your OpenClaw assistant can help you add these integrations when you need them.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Is this stack suitable for large websites with hundreds of pages?</h3>
      <p>Yes. 11ty is specifically designed to handle large sites efficiently — it can build thousands of pages in seconds. The only consideration is build time, which scales linearly with page count. Sites with 500+ pages might take 30-60 seconds to build, which is still far faster than most alternatives.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How do I get help if something goes wrong?</h3>
      <p>Your OpenClaw assistant can diagnose and fix most issues directly. For stack-specific questions, the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11ty documentation</a> and AWS Amplify docs are excellent resources. The OpenClaw Discord community is also very active and helpful for troubleshooting.</p>
