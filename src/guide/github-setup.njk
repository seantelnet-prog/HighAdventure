<section class="guide">
  <h1>2. Set Up GitHub Access</h1>
  <p class="lead">Give your OpenClaw assistant secure access to push code to your repository.</p>

  <h2>Why SSH Keys?</h2>
  <p>SSH keys let your assistant interact with GitHub without storing passwords or tokens in chat. It's more secure and only needs to be set up once per server.</p>

  <h2>What to Tell Your Assistant</h2>
  <blockquote>
    "Generate an SSH key for GitHub access."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Your assistant will:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Generate an SSH key pair on the server</li>
    <li>Show you the public key</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Add the Key to GitHub</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys</a></li>
    <li>Click <strong>New SSH key</strong></li>
    <li>Paste the public key your assistant provided</li>
    <li>Give it a name like "OpenClaw Server"</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Add SSH key</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Tell your assistant:</p>
  <blockquote>"I've added the SSH key to GitHub. My repo is at https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git"</blockquote>

  <h2>Verify Access</h2>
  <p>Your assistant will test the connection by cloning your repository. If successful, they can now push code, create branches, and manage your site.</p>

  <h2>Already Have SSH Set Up?</h2>
  <p>If you've already configured SSH keys for your OpenClaw server, just tell your assistant where your repo is:</p>
  <blockquote>"I've cloned the Made With Claw template to https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git — please clone it and verify access."</blockquote>
